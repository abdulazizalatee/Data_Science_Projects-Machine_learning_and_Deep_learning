Data Descriptions:
The data was in several files so I used SQL to collect the data in one table (as a variable) and use it in the analysis.

Results:
- In any analysis process, we need to put questions that help us in the analysis process and search for what is needed.
- Data analysis requires a high concentration and understanding of the field to extract outputs that contribute to work development and problem solving
